### Project Description
Oftentimes it’s difficult for local businesses to get the word out about 
their business if they are constantly overshadowed by larger, more 
international companies. Since many of these local businesses cannot 
fork over the funds to purchase advertising on billboards or pages in a 
magazine/newspaper, a simpler and cost-effective solution should be given 
to these people so that their businesses can grow. Oftentimes2000 allows 
these local small businesses to advertise and broadcast the location of 
their business to anyone who owns a smartphone. The idea is that a company 
can post an advertisement or a deal and “push” it to anyone who owns the 
application.
In addition to advertising space, public announcements are also made 
available through the application such as weather alerts, amber alerts, 
crime alerts, etc. Police department can send out a public service 
announcement about recently reported crime, enhancing local security. 
Another example, National Weather Service can broadcast tornado warnings 
or other weather alerts to the town more effectively by sending a push 
notification.
The users will have an option to pick and select what kind of categories 
that they want to subscribe. For example, if they want to keep up with 
any local deals, they should subscribe to local deals category. Therefore, 
the users will not be bothered by any events or advertisements that they 
do not like. Moreover, you can view the map which is integrated in our 
application in order to locate all the events that you have subscribed to.### User Archetype and Use CasesOur users archetypes are those who are interested in finding local deal 
and events that may be taking place. Particularly, those people that wish 
there is an all-in-one application that lists all local deals, news and 
events. Moreover, local businesses, schools, law enforcement, and news 
stations will be the second set of users who would provide the content 
to be displayed in the application.Let’s say a client wants to advertise a special event for the middle of the 
week at a certain time. They can log into the application, select the date 
of the event, the time, and the location, then post it a few days before 
the event to ensure people see it in time. After the event is finished, 
the event marker on the map and in the list of available events in the area 
will disappear. Then, if the client wishes to make another event, they can 
follow the same steps as above.
A customer can opens the application to check if there are deals or events 
occurring in the near future, they can open the application and see a list 
of available events and deals listed in chronological order. When they choose 
an event/advertisement they are taken to a screen where more detailed 
information is presented along with an option to view in a map.### Shortcomings of the Current SolutionThere is no an all-in-one local announcement and/or advertising service. 
We can pick Groupon as an example. It surely offers local deals, but it does 
not list any local news or events. Furthermore, it doesn’t have push 
notification system integrated. Users have to open the app in order to find 
any local deals.
Another good example would be Craigslist. Craigslist is crowdsource service 
in which there is no limitation on who can make a post. Our app, since it is 
planned to be a paid service, will ensure the legitimacy of the advertiser. 
Also, Craigslist’s proximity is limited to high population city. Hence, if 
you have a business in small town, you will not be able to advertise your 
business in Craigslist. Another limitation is that if you want to broadcast 
your campus event, you cannot target the audience only to your campus 
residents.### Technologies* Android OS* GPS service* Google Maps* GCM (Google Cloud Messaging)* PHP and MySQL* HTTPRequest (Java Socket)### References
